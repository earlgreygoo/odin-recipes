			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p> Pecan cookies are a change of pace from the traditional chocolate chip cookies. The pecan oil lends a depth of richness.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
				<li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
				<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
				<li>2 large eggs</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon pecan oil, optional</li>
				<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
				<li>â…› teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 cup finely chopped pecans</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
				<li>Combine butter, brown sugar, and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and pecan oil and beat until well combined.</li>
				<li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture to the bowl in 3 additions. Stir in pecans. Use a small cookie scoop to drop portions of dough 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. These cookies spread.</li>
				<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Increase heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until edges turn golden, about 5 minutes more. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to racks to cool completely.</li>
